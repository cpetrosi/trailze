Trailze Project SRS Evaluation
==============================

Nice job on this, a very good document.

Carleen -- looks like you've really got this requirements thing nailed
down!  Good coverage of the requirements, good breakdown of things, 
proper language and all the grammar is correct, good descriptive 
paragraphs for each of your components...  SWEET!!

One thing to check is to be sure you only specify ONE requirement in each
"shall" statement.  If you see the word "and" or "or" that *usually* means
you could split that into two requirements, or perhaps a "shall" followed
by a "will"....


Deliverable D-02: 15% out of 15% = 100% which is an A-plus
Deliverable D-05:  5% out of  5% = 100% which is an A-plus

Keep up the good work!
